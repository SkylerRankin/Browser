<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is that strange looking duck?&nbsp; It doesn’t look familiar, and you can’t find  it in your field guide.&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waterfowl  can be fun for beginning birders because they are relatively easy to watch, not  flitting through the trees or into the bushes like little dicky birds.&nbsp; They have very distinctive plumages with  large patches of color in bold patterns that make identification relatively  easy.&nbsp; True, the female dabblers all look  pretty much alike, but the males are distinctive.&nbsp; So what do you do when you run up against  something you can’t identify and can’t find in the books?&nbsp; How can you figure out what it is?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duck  identification problems often fall into one of only a few categories.&nbsp; In this article I will attempt to explain some  of them and give common examples of each.</font></p>
<hr width="50%">
<p><font size="+2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>It’s a domestic duck.</strong> &nbsp;</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is  probably the most common answer to most beginning birder’s duck problems.&nbsp; Domestic duck breeds are not illustrated in  most field guides, and the older guides did not mention this problem at  all.&nbsp; When people go out looking for wild  birds they seem to forget that domestic breeds exist.&nbsp; <strong>First rule of thumb:&nbsp; If your weird duck is found at a park,  walking around on the grass or coming near people, it is probably a domestic  duck. </strong>&nbsp;But, these domestic monsters  do get mixed up in flocks of wild birds, too, so how do you spot them?&nbsp; <strong>Second rule of thumb:&nbsp; If your duck has large patches of white where  you didn’t expect it, think domestic duck.</strong>&nbsp;  People seem to love to breed white or partially white domestic animals,  presumably because such mutations don’t do well in the wild and consequently  are rare.&nbsp; Such mutations do turn up in  the wild, though, and we’ll discuss them later, but for now, if you see big  patches of white, think domestic duck.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Only two  species of ducks have been domesticated:&nbsp;  the <strong>Mallard</strong> (<em>Anas platyrhynchos</em>) and the <strong>Muscovy Duck</strong> (<em>Cairina  moschata</em>).&nbsp;</font></p>
  <table width="816" height="184" border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="233"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let’s deal with the  <strong>Muscovy Duck</strong> first, as it’s pretty easy to tell.&nbsp; The most obvious character of a muscovy is  the red facial skin.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your duck has a  red face, it’s probably a Muscovy Duck.&nbsp;  This red skin can be quite bumpy, exaggerated, and frankly, gross, with  a knob on top of the bill and lumps all over.&nbsp;  If you see that, it’s a slam dunk Muscovy Duck.&nbsp; The wild type plumage of muscovy is all black,  glossy greenish on the back, and with large white wing patches.&nbsp; But, because of our fondness for white,  domestic muscovies can be pure white, all black, or any degree of pied  black-and-white.</font></td>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <strong>Mallard  breeds </strong>can be somewhat confusing.&nbsp; They  can be larger than normal or much smaller, darker or lighter, all white or all  black.&nbsp; Watch for the little curled  feathers on the back of the male, above the tail.&nbsp; Only the Mallard and its domestic descendants  have those.&nbsp; (Well, the Hawaiian Duck  does too, but the chances of seeing one of those around here is about zero.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, lots  of white is often involved, including all-white breeds like the popular Pekin  Duck.&nbsp; Another common form is the bibbed  version. It has a sort of normal body and head plumage, and a white chest.&nbsp; Other forms and crosses can have spots of  white just about anywhere.&nbsp; Usually these  white spots are not symmetrical across both sides, and that asymmetry should  tip you off to think domestic influence.</font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passion  for weird plumage in domestic ducks does not stop with white, but can go the  other way too.&nbsp; Some breeds are darker  than normal Mallard plumage.&nbsp; One popular  dark breed is known as the “Cayuga Duck,” and it may have actually originated  in our area (central New York) in the 19th century.&nbsp;  This duck is dark all over and rather iridescent, like its shiny  speculum feathers got spread over the entire bird.&nbsp; Very handsome, indeed. &nbsp;Other color variations include faded and pale  versions of normal (“apricot,” “buff,” or “fawn”), somewhat darker and without  the white neck ring (“dusky”), or faded silvery (“blue”).&nbsp; There are lots of other weirdnesses too,  including topknots and strange, barbless feathers, but I’d rather not go into  them.&nbsp; Just be aware that very odd things  exist in the world of domestic poultry, and oddity should make you consider  domestic origin.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Body size  can often be a clue toward domesticity.&nbsp;  The first breeds of domestic Mallard were bred for food, and  consequently for large body size.&nbsp; A  domestic duck can be twice the size of a wild Mallard.&nbsp; Even if they’re not obviously larger, they  tend to be bulkier and more dumpy looking, especially in the belly.&nbsp; But, domestics can be smaller than normal  too.&nbsp; Indian runner ducks are long and  lean.&nbsp; These are very odd, tall, skinny  ducks that look like bowling pins.&nbsp; They  are great egg producers but have totally tubular bodies.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pygmies of the domestic duck world are  the “Call” ducks.&nbsp; Call ducks are tiny,  teal-sized things that have smaller bills and more rounded heads than normal  ducks.&nbsp; That means they’re cuter.&nbsp; They were originally bred as live decoys to  attract or “call” wild ducks in to be shot, and are still sometimes known as  decoy ducks.&nbsp; They can have normal  Mallard plumage, white, faded, or dark.&nbsp;  Males will still have the curled tail feathers and the plumage will  generally fit in the same basic categories as the other Mallard types.&nbsp; The recent call duck hanging out at Union  Springs, NY is a male (with some problems), and can be recognized by his cute look,  curled tail feathers, “dusky” coloring, and the fact that he’s in love with a  female Mallard.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; Ducks are good fliers, and some fly long  distances in migration.&nbsp; That means  sometimes we get European or Asian ducks turning up in North America. &nbsp;Such an occurrence is pretty rare, though, and  the few species that do this are generally illustrated in the field guides.&nbsp; More frequently than that, we find escaped  “pet” ducks.&nbsp; Keeping ornamental  waterfowl is very popular.&nbsp; It can be  surprising how many people have captive ducks and geese.&nbsp; Sometimes these ducks get loose, and  sometimes their owners get rid of them by turning them out on a pond or lake.&nbsp; The best local examples of this phenomenon  are the Mandarin Duck pair that was at Myers Point, Lansing, NY briefly in January 2003, and the  Red-crested Pochards (and hybrid) that put in an appearance there many years  ago.&nbsp; Although owners of domestic ducks  are supposed to put bands on their birds and clip off the hind claw on each foot,  that doesn’t seem to happen all that often, and birds are out there without  these marks of captivity.&nbsp; One mark that  seems to show up more frequently is pinioning, where the tip of one wing is  surgically removed to keep the bird from flying.&nbsp; When pinioned ducks flap, you can see the  half-a-wing pretty clearly (as was the case with the aforementioned  pochards).&nbsp; A number of guides to all of  the ducks of the world are available, so a quick browse through one of them  might find your odd duck.&nbsp; If not, try  one of the other possibilities.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most common in central New York are Mallard X American Black Duck hybrids.&nbsp;  (It turns out that most females of the Mallard close relatives find a  green head really sexy, and they will hook up with Mallard males whenever they  are available.&nbsp; Such propensities create  some conservation concern when domestic Mallards are introduced into the range  of some other species, such as American Black Duck or Mottled Duck.)&nbsp; </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes the hybrid pairs are between  species that are not closely related, such as Hooded Merganser X Common  Goldeneye.&nbsp;In captivity where ducks from all over are housed together, anything can happen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The clues for finding a  hybrid are not so clear cut.&nbsp; The easiest  way to spot them is when they have characters intermediate between the parental  species.&nbsp; Look for a duck that looks  familiar, but just doesn’t look quite right.&nbsp;  A black duck X Mallard male will often have the mostly dull plumage of  the black duck and some green on the head.&nbsp;  It may or may not have the curled feathers over the tail, and the  speculum can be blue like a Mallard or more purple like the black duck.&nbsp; Small green patches on the head can be a good  sign of some Mallard parentage.&nbsp; In  general, watch for symmetrical abnormalities, patches of color or lack of  color.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amongst the dabbling ducks  certain patterns seem to occur in hybrids, even if they are not present in the  parents.&nbsp; Pale cheeks and a Baikal Teal  face pattern can result from a number of different pairings. Note its presence, if faint, in the second Mallard X black duck pictured above. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A recent hybrid duck in Union Springs, NY resembles a duck illustrated by Audubon and described as “<strong>Brewer’s Duck</strong>.”&nbsp; It has a dark cap with some greenish sheen, a  pale to tan cheek, a dark neck ring, a lighter thin neck ring, a dark chest,  dark sides, black rear end with a faint white stripe in front of it, and a whitish  tail.&nbsp; Audubon thought that his bird  might be a cross between a Mallard and a Gadwall.&nbsp; The Union Springs Brewer’s Duck is very  similar.&nbsp; The green on the head, white  tail, black rear end, and pale neck ring are good Mallard characters.&nbsp; The gray sides, dark rear end, and  intricately patterned chest suggest Gadwall.&nbsp;  Where the face patch comes from is anybody’s guess, and nothing has a  black-and-tan bill like this bird.&nbsp; But  does this bird have Mallard in it?&nbsp; It  looks very similar to a specimen in Gillham and Gillham (1996, Hybrid Ducks)  that is labeled as Gadwall X Northern Pintail. &nbsp;It’s hard to know for sure, and Gillham and  Gillhan (1996) give several known combinations that look like this duck.</font></p>
